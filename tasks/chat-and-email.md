# Task: Chat Logs and Email Threads

Users sometimes paste a conversation or email thread and ask you to incorporate ideas from it into the paper.

## The Endorsement Problem

A chat log contains many voices and many tentative ideas. You must NOT treat every statement in the thread as the user's position. Conversations involve negotiation, pushback, and ideas that were raised and then rejected. Incorporating an unendorsed idea is worse than omitting a good one, because it misrepresents the user's argument.

## What Counts as Endorsed

Only incorporate content that meets at least one of the following conditions:

1. **Explicit agreement in the thread.** The user visibly agreed with a statement during the conversation (e.g., "Yes, exactly," "I think that's right," "That's the point I want to make," "Good point").
2. **Instruction from the user.** The user's accompanying message explicitly identifies which ideas to use (e.g., "use the point about X from this thread," "incorporate the second paragraph of my reply").

If neither condition is met for a given idea, treat it as background context only—do not include it in the paper.

## Workflow

1. Read the entire thread carefully before touching the paper.
2. Map each substantive claim to its speaker and assess whether the user endorsed it.
3. Extract only endorsed ideas, noting the original phrasing for reference.
4. Integrate those ideas organically into the paper—do not quote the chat verbatim. Translate conversational language into academic prose.
5. If it is genuinely unclear whether the user endorses something, flag it in your output rather than guessing.

## Output Note

When reporting back, briefly list what you included and what you omitted from the thread, so the user can verify your endorsement judgments.
