# Task: User-Authored Documents

Users may paste or attach a document they wrote—a draft section, personal notes, a memo—and ask you to incorporate it into the paper.

## Why Copy-Paste Fails

Even when the document is the user's own writing, transplanting it verbatim almost always produces problems:

- Informal documents often use bullet points, numbered lists, or casual phrasing that clashes with journal style.
- The document was written without the surrounding paper as context, so it may repeat existing content or create gaps.
- Register and voice may differ from the rest of the paper (first-person singular vs. "we," informal hedging, etc.).

Never copy-paste. Always rewrite.

## Workflow

1. Read the user's document in full.
2. Read the target section of the paper (and adjacent sections if boundaries are unclear).
3. Identify the core claims, evidence, and structure in the document.
4. Rewrite the content in the paper's established register and voice.
5. Ensure smooth transitions: the new material should read as if it were always part of the paper, not as a grafted block.
6. Check for overlap with existing paper content—consolidate rather than duplicate.
7. If the document contains material that belongs in different sections of the paper, split it accordingly rather than inserting it all in one place.
